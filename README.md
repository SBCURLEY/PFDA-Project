## Installation
I had to install the below to get started on this repository
- Python 
- Visual Studio Code
- Cmder
- Jupyter notebook
- github

## Usage
Once the above is installed is complete, you can run the notebook

## Dependencies
The following libraries are required to execute my notebook:
- `matplotlib.pyplot`: Essential for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python. It is closely integrated with NumPy and provides a MATLAB-like interface for creating plots and visualizations.
- `numpy`: It contains functionality for multidimensional arrays, high-level mathematical functions such as linear algebra operations.
- `pandas`: Fundamental data analysis and manipulation library built on top of the Python programming language. It offers data structures and operations for manipulating numerical tables and time series.
- `seaborn`: Seaborn is a Python data visualization library based on matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.
- `datetime`: The datetime is a built-in module that provides classes for manipulating dates and times

Using python, import the following as per notebook

`import matplotlib.pyplot as plt`

`import numpy as np`

`import pandas as pd`

`import seaborn as sns`

`import datetime`

## About Author
- Sharon Curley
  
    My role is a Business Systems Analyst for [Meissner Corporation](https://www.meissner.com/) - a manufacturing company in Castlebar, Co. Mayo. The systems I am supporting currently are Microsoft Dynamics 365 (ERP) for all Meissner entities (Ireland, US, Switzerland, Germany & Italy). I initially started out in functional areas like Customer Service & Supply Chain as I was lucky to be one of the first crew members on board in this company in 2020. I have moved into the IT Dept since March last year. I have a background in SAP - projects & support, so was drawn back into this area when I saw the opportunity arise within Meissner. I have a keen interest in data as when I was a functional user that was the most challenging part of my role - trying to get meaningful data from the systems we use. I have used excel to an advanced level and started with Power BI. I see a lot of opportunities within Meissner to develop in the Data field. I am hoping I will have the skills to do so.
