This repository contains my project submission for the module Programming for Data Analytics.
My github repository link is as follows:

[SBCURLEY/pfda-project](https://github.com/SBCURLEY/pfda-project)

## Installation
I had to install the below to get started on this repository
- Python 
- Visual Studio Code
- Cmder
- Jupyter notebook
- github

## Dependencies
The following libraries are required to execute my notebook:
- `matplotlib.pyplot`: Essential for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python. It is closely integrated with NumPy and provides a MATLAB-like interface for creating plots and visualizations.
- `numpy`: It contains functionality for multidimensional arrays, high-level mathematical functions such as linear algebra operations.
- `pandas`: Fundamental data analysis and manipulation library built on top of the Python programming language. It offers data structures and operations for manipulating numerical tables and time series.
- `seaborn`: Seaborn is a Python data visualization library based on matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.
- `datetime`: The datetime is a built-in module that provides classes for manipulating dates and times
- `re`: The re module provides a set of functions to work with regular expressions, used for searching, matching, and manipulating strings.
- `matplotlib.dates`: Matplotlib provides sophisticated date plotting capabilities, standing on the shoulders of python datetime and the add-on module dateutil.

Using python, import the following as per notebook

`import matplotlib.pyplot as plt`

`import numpy as np`

`import pandas as pd`

`import seaborn as sns`

`import datetime`

`import re`

`import matplotlib.dates as mdates`

## Usage
Once the above is installed, you can run the notebook for the project `rppr.ipynb`

## Repository Structure

1. data folder: This folder contains the dataset from the Residential Property Price Register website that was used for this project

1. Images folder: contains two images used for the Readme & the notebook [[1]](https://www.mercy.edu/sites/default/files/styles/1600x700/public/2020-07/iStock-1150199386.jpg?h=6510ad6e&itok=kyPCa_AE)

2. gitignore

3. rppr.ipynb: The project is contained in this Jupyter Notebook. The project analyses the Residential Property Price Index (RPPI) between 2010 and 2024. The RPPI is an important economic indicator that tracks changes in the prices of residential properties across Ireland. The data is collected by the Central Statistics Office (CSO) and provides insights into the trends in the housing market, showing whether property prices are rising or falling over time. This makes the RPPI a valuable tool for homebuyers, sellers, policymakers, and economists to understand and analyse the real estate market. I began my analysis on the national dataset, and then Co. Mayo followed by Castlebar for further analysis.

## About Author
- Sharon Curley
  
    My role is a Business Systems Analyst for [Meissner Corporation](https://www.meissner.com/) - a manufacturing company in Castlebar, Co. Mayo. The systems I am supporting currently are Microsoft Dynamics 365 (ERP) for all Meissner entities (Ireland, US, Switzerland, Germany & Italy). I initially started out in functional areas,  Customer Service & Supply Chain. I was lucky to be one of the first crew members on board in this company in 2020. I have moved into the IT Dept since March last year. I have a background in SAP - projects & support, so was drawn back into this area when I saw the opportunity arise within Meissner. I have a keen interest in data as when I was a functional user that was the most challenging part of my role - trying to get meaningful data from the systems we use. I have used excel to an advanced level and started with Power BI. I see a lot of opportunities within Meissner to develop in the Data field. I am hoping I will have the skills to do so.
